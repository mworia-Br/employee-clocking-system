## About ECS

ECS (with facial recognition) is a web application built with NodeJs Express framework and the pug template engine. It was built in 2020 as a CSC final year project.
<br>
It uses some face models to recognize faces, get the expressions on those faces as well as the landmarks. Upon registration, the user provides an image capture of his/her face which will be used when clocking in or out to recognize the user and authorize the user into the application.
